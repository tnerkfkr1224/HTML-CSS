                     Ceylon Textile Suppliers (CTS), an Australian owned organization based in Melbourne which supplies clothing related products to Australian and New Zealand retail outlets on a sale or return basis. It has an annual turnover of around $ 60M and plans to expand. And the same innovation that goes into our products also applies to our practices — strengthening our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. This is where your work can make a difference in people’s lives. Including your own.
                     To support our growth, we have multiple openings available for passionate workers with varying degrees of experience to join us on our journey!

              <h4>Welcoming is one thing. Belonging is everything.</h4><hr>
              At CTS, you can expect the respect and support of an inclusive community throughout your time here. One of the most meaningful ways to find that experience is by joining a Diversity Network Association: employee-led groups rooted in the celebration and amplification of culturally underrepresented communities, creating even more opportunities to belong, learn and grow.
